## Data Storage
Although serialization was initially implemented. The program was switched over to text file data storage because extensive program features would otherwise be needed to manage task data over revisions of the data structure and user error.

#### Task Data
- File Organization
-- Blocks of task data on a single line, each line it's own task.
- Delimiters
-- :$: is used as the delimiter between different fields of the same task.
-- A new line differentiates one task from the other in a file.

#### Logging
- Each command from the user is time stamped and listed in the log file.
- This file is in no way used to store task data. It was only implemented for debugging desperate data recovery purposes.

## File and Code Organization
***This section of the code and document got major updates during sprint 3.***

![](/home/lindsay/Pictures/Screenshot from 2018-02-24 20-26-43.png) 

```
/**
 * The main class of the program handels initizliations and termination of the program, this includes:
 * Opening and closing files, and passing start up commands to the appropriate places.
 * /
class TM{ }
```
	
appMain (string[] args);
1. Open the log file and instantiate the Logger
2. Open the data file and instantiate the Encoder
3. Load the list of tasks from the Encoder.
4. Instantiate the TaskManager, passing it the list of tasks.
5. Instantiate the Interface, passing in the Logger and the TaskManager.
6. Pass the arguments to the Interface and ask it to do itâ€™s thing.
7. Get the list of tasks from the TaskManager and store them in the loader. 
 
```
/**
 * Handels user input / output. Passes information to primary functions of the program for execution.
 * (how to handle errors from other classes?)
 * /
class InterfaceCmdLn{ }
```

1. Constructor InterfaceCmdLine(TaskManager tm, Logger logger)
- Just store this stuff.

2. takeAction(string[] args)
- Parses the command line and decides what action to take.
- Asks the TaskManager to take that action, passing it any relevant information.
- Prints relevant results, if any, probably because it got a reference to an updated task as a return value.
- Logs the action via the logger.


```
/**
 * Handles reading and writing to files. Was trying to name this with a noun (Data Encoder) but then 
 * added file to the end to differentate from "database" or some other future type of data storage
 * method.
 * /
 class Encoder{ }
```
Constructor FileEncoder(File file)

 - write()
 - read() //and load into list for the rest of the program to use
- taskToDataString(delimiter) //takes a delimiter and returns the task as a single string for storage in file

 
	  	
```
/**
 * A system that manages execution all the user accessible features (handels data logic). 
 * A new TaskManager is created for each call to a command.
 * /
class TaskManager{ }
```

- startTimer()
- stopTimer()
- setDescription()
- getTaskByName()
- setSize()
- Delete()
- Rename()



``` 
/**
 * A task object
 * /
class Task{ }
```

- var name, size, description, duration
- all the getters and setters (description setter must append)

 
```
/**
 * Recommended by my instructor, an object to manage start, stop and (more generally) time spent
 * on a task. Would contain methods for handling lists of starts and stop and returning total durations
 * for summaries.
 * /
class Duration{ }
```

- var listOfStartTimes, listOfEndTimes
- start() // logs a start time
- stop() // logs an end time
- totalDuration()
  
```
/**
 * A simple class that can be sent input for logging. This intention is that it's sent raw command input
 * which in then stored in a log file. Could consider also sending command line ouput or command success
 * status at some later date.
 * /
 Logger{ }
 ```

Constructor Logger(File file)
void logEvent(event String);

## Control Structures
Please note that I don't often code without speicific implementation instructions. In most cases it's likely that I could be more clever or efficient with the Java language. This is because I haven't worked on many (if any) projects that allowed me to use the full suite of feautres provided by the Java API and so I don't know how to use many of them.

I wished for a control structure that would allow me to execute various different commands until it failed an expression.
For instance:
if (a >= 1) statement 1;
and if (a >=2) statment 2;
and if (a >= 3) statement 3;
This would be to avoid the repeated statemetns in the argument parsing in appMain.

## API
The Time package was new to me, I used this site for information on implementation.

Please note that I don't often code without speicific implementation instructions. In most cases it's likely that I could be more clever or efficient with the Java language. This is because I haven't worked on many (if any) projects that allowed me to use the full suite of feautres provided by the Java API and so I don't know how to use many of them. For this reason it took a lot of effort to get serializing and date and times working correctly.

## Exception Handling
I'm pretty terrible at knowing where I should implement try catch blocks. I only vaguely understand what they do and so I can't use any knowledge about them to understand where they would be appropriate to use. This is something I need to work on. 

## Serializing
Initially I chose to implement the serializable interface class built into Java. This was recommended by an experienced programmer and made it very quick to get my program up and running. However, when the object structure is changed the pervious serialized file is not loger compatable with the new objects. This meant that the task data wouldn't be able to persist from one sprint to the next if there were any changes to the object structure, which there were. In addition, I had a better understanding of how a simple token dilimited text file could be written after discussing sprint 1 in class. There for, in sprint 2, I implemented my own class TmSerialize, to manage writing data to a file.

.[Expereienced programming resrouce].(http://periodic.github.io/Resume/resume.html)

## Tokenizing
I didn't end up tokenizing strings and saving them to a data file. When writing to a file was first suggested in class I didn't understand what the parameters were in the meaning of that instruction. Technically I am using a file to store data and so I didn't seem like I was on the wrong path. However, when it was explained in more detail on Friday I then realized I was employing a different strategy than what the instructor was invisioning. However, it didn't seem like this was a problem for the application desgin, and the specifications say this part of the implimentation is flexible, so I moved forward with the implementation I had. One downside I found was that I couldn't manually alter data in a the text file. While that is good for programs with causual users, being able to directly modify the data may have been useful for testing.

## Log Class
Because I used the seralizing method, there was very little I needed to write to handle the logging functionality. Therefore, I did not write a seperate class for logging.

## Scalability
This process seems inefficient to read the entire set of data from a file each time a small process is run (start/stop). Seems fine for a small program, but would be bad for scalability to a larger program. If the project were to become larger some other data storage method would need to be considered.

## Additional Features
During the process of implementing and testing there were several features that I had wished for or thought would be useful to a user of this program.
- Delete tasks
- Edit/update additional task fields including
> Name
> Start/Stop times
> More collaberation 
> - rarely does a person work alone on a programming project where they also need to track tasks
- Add a way to see if a new task is in progress or not (fixes the problem of a started, brand new task, in progress, summary showing no times and no indication the start task worked).

## Test Cases
- where a log file exists and <task name> is 
> a non-existing task
> an existing task
- where no log file exists yet and <task name> is
> a non-existing task
> an existing task
java TM start <task name>
java TM stop <task name>
java TM describe <task name> <description>
> Additionally: when description is alreay present, and when it's not
java TM summary <task name>
java TM summary
